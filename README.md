# 📚 Book Catalog

A responsive and clean web app that fetches books and genres from two separate APIs. Built with vanilla JavaScript and styled entirely using **Bootstrap**—no custom CSS, except one line for image width (just to be honest 😉).

## 🔍 Features

- Fetches books from an external API
- Fetches genres from a separate API
- Search by:
  - Book title
  - Author
  - Genre (via input or clicking on listed genres)
- One-click reset to view all books again
- Adaptive design for all screen sizes
- Minimalist layout with Bootstrap components
